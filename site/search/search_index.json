The analysis aims to identify potential vulnerabilities and guide the secure development and deployment of MCP-based applications.</p> <p>MCP facilitates powerful integrations but introduces significant security considerations that must be addressed by implementers (Hosts, Clients, Servers), as the protocol itself cannot enforce many security guarantees. Key high-risk areas include:</p> <ol> <li>Tool Execution (<code>tools/call</code>): Represents a direct arbitrary code execution risk requiring rigorous server-side input validation, authorization, output sanitization, and strong client-side user confirmation.</li> <li>User Consent &amp; Control: The specification mandates, and secure implementation demands, explicit, informed user consent mediated by the Host/Client for actions like tool execution, sampling requests, and resource access. Failure here undermines the entire security model.</li> <li>Resource Access (<code>resources/read</code>, etc.): Requires meticulous server-side URI validation (preventing path traversal) and strict access control checks before serving resource data.</li> <li>Input Validation: Both Clients and Servers must rigorously validate all incoming parameters to prevent various injection attacks and denial-of-service.</li> <li>Sampling (<code>sampling/createMessage</code>): Exposes risks of prompt injection against the client's LLM and potential resource abuse (cost, rate limits) if not carefully controlled by the client with user oversight.</li> </ol> <p>Secure implementation requires adherence to principles like least privilege, defense-in-depth, secure defaults, transport security (HTTPS/WSS), robust authentication/authorization (e.g., OAuth 2.1/PKCE), careful data handling to prevent leakage (especially in logs and errors), and secure interaction with external systems.

The security relies heavily on how the incoming URI string from the client's <code>resources/read</code> request is parsed and converted into this <code>Path</code> object before <code>FileResource</code> is instantiated. The <code>validate_absolute_path</code> check alone does not prevent path traversal attacks like <code>file:///c:/allowed_dir/../forbidden_dir/secret.txt</code>. Such an input could resolve to an absolute path (<code>c:\\forbidden_dir\\secret.txt</code>) that passes the <code>is_absolute()</code> check but accesses an unauthorized location.</li> <li>Needed: A crucial validation step appears missing within the reviewed <code>FileResource</code> code: checking if the resolved absolute path is confined within a pre-defined, allowed base directory or set of roots.

The <code>get_resource</code> method itself does not perform path canonicalization or boundary checks on the input URI string before lookup or template matching/creation.
